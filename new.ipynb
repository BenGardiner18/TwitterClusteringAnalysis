After quantifying their word choices and frequencies I could group various users by their similarities and differences using a clustering technique called K-means clustering.\n",

    "From our dataset containing tweet texts, I decided to use the TF-IDF vectorizer to turn our lists of tweet contents into a matrix. For every word in the dataset we can see how often the user uses it with respect to the words overall popularity. For example, Kevin Hart's information is shown below; he seemed to use the words tickets, presale, posted, kevin, and photo a lot. Understanding that there was still a lot of noise in the data matrix I decided the use SVD and analyse the principal components of the matrix to see if I could reduce it. Using PCA, which centers the data and approximates it to a lower rank, we are given a smaller and slightly more managable matrix that still contained useful information. "

    "Overall, the clustering did a pretty good job at grouping together twitter users. While the score is still quite low, it still does a relatively good job of grouping together similar users. There are some issues however. Most real tweets on twitter are either advertisements from bots or simply random useless texts. If this project was used for many more random users, instead of a small sample of relatively similar and popular twitter accounts, it might struggle. Also, getting all the tweet information from the users takes a long time, so the data collection process isn't very effecient for getting lots of tweets from lots of users. "
